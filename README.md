# Green-Financial-Index
The paper, "Crafting Indiaâ€™s Green Financial Index: A Comprehensive State-Level Assessment," provided a structured framework for analyzing green finance efficiency across Indian states. Through extensive secondary data collection, I gathered insights from various financial and environmental sources, ensuring rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to manage inconsistencies and normalize variables. Employing the Low Entropy Weight (LEW) model, I developed a robust econometric approach to assess green finance, refining my skills in quantitative analysis, index construction, and econometric modeling. This experience has strengthened my ability to perform similar modeling exercises in other economic areas, such as infrastructure investment, climate finance, and development economics, enhancing my research capabilities for future roles.
